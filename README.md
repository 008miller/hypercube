## Wha is HyperCube

HyperCube is an Ethereum 2-layer solution based on proof of POD dedication and an independent public chain.

## Formal State

HyperCube's network is an independent public chain written in Rust language based on PoD consensus.

PoD is a new network consensus algorithm based on a hybrid consensus of PoW (ETHash) and PoS (Dedication Formula), which determines the blockchain network accounting privileges from multi-dimensional parameters such as time, network coupling, community participation, and online time.

The PoD consensus + XPZ public chain helps Ethereum increase network transaction speed and reduce Gas fees. At the same time, the introduction of the EVERNET permanent storage network can provide decentralized permanent storage space for financial infrastructure, the Internet of Things, and the Internet.


## XPZ mining machine

XPZ mining machine is based on the dual-core mining mode of Nvdia and AMD. Based on the special structure of PoD, XPZ can conduct joint mining with ETH, which saves energy and achieves the goal of carbon neutrality on the chain.

After XPZ upgrades the perpetual storage network, large-scale on-chain low-cost storage can be realized, which provides a guarantee for permanent storage of data by facilitating hard disk storage space.

## The birth of the public chain

The XPZ development team is guided by multiple Turing Award winners as consultants, and the Ethereum technical team guides the development. Grayscale and Coinbase fragments. XPZ, under the joint promotion of many geek technology enthusiasts and teams around the world, actively explores the new Ethereum The road to expansion.

The XPZ (full name HyperCube) public chain supports large-scale, multi-threaded, multi-concurrent network computing and storage capabilities such as NFT casting, social tokens, DeFi, and financial applications.


## XPZ's core advantages

* Support game financial GameFi, chain games, decentralized financial DeFi, XPZ system built-in Athena SDK, can help develop the rapid development of GameFi and DeFi products.

* XPZ core provides EVM general XVM (XPZ virtual machine), which is faster than EVM and enables Ethereum developers to get started quickly

* Low gas fee, fast response

* Athena SDK can provide fast casting NFT, low-cost digital art creation

* Anonymous social + OTC + wallet, XPZ wallet supports anonymous social, OTC and token storage, facilitating quick realization of NFT creators, and supporting the issuance of social tokens and personal NFT works

* XPZ supports a hybrid on-chain transaction engine based on order books and automated market makers, which can help DeFi to be implemented on a large scale

* Strong academic background: PoD and XPZ core technologies have passed peer review and will be released in international academic conferences soon

* Endorsed by IEEE and other international blockchain standard organizations

* Traditional American capital includes endorsement
