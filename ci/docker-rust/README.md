Docker image containing rust and some preinstalled packages used in CI.

This image may be manually updated by running `./build.sh` if you are a member
of the [HyperCube Labs](https://hub.docker.com/u/hypercubelabs/) Docker Hub
organization, but it is also automatically updated periodically by
[this automation](https://buildkite.com/hypercube-labs/hypercube-ci-docker-rust).
